##  Project Description 
The *energy monitoring* module shown above is an open-source project designed to help enthusiasts monitor energy consumed with the aid of current and voltage sensors. To help address the issue of unclear electric usage and tariffs, you can explore using this unit to wirelessly monitor energy consumption. To ensure easy access to the data acquired by the voltage and current sensors, two wireless communication modules were incorporated onboard. This includes a LoRa_E5 Module to initiate LoRaWAN Communication and a NINA module to provide access to data via WiFi or BLE. *Altium Designer* is the software used for this project.


## ü§ñ Schematics?

The schematics are two sheets in total. Sheet 1 contains symbols and connections for highspeed USB-C, Atemga328 MCU, 6-pin headers, RGB module, USB to Serial IC, terminal blocks, and 12V to 5V power converter. Sheet 2 contains symbols for a LoRa_E5 module, a NINA-W102-00B, and a bidirectional 5V to 3V3 level translator.
