##  Project Description 
This project aimed to develop a visual representation of soil moisture and pH across farmlands. We can do this by acquiring PH and Moisture data using suitable sensors. The module's location (later vision) will help establish a GPS waypoint on the farmland to help us understand which area of the farmland is being measured. GPS coordinates, soil moisture, and soil PH is collected and transmitted to a gateway.


## ü§ñ Schematics?

The schematics are all on one sheet. The Sheet contains symbols and connections for a USB-C, ESP32-C3 Soc, RGB module, 2MB flash storage, terminal blocks, a buzzer, optocouplers, and 12V to 5V power converter
